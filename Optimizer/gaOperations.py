As stated in the testGA, the y=target is to minimize:
    y = f(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6)
    To asses this one, we use a Fitness function that depends on the analytical results derived from the FEA
    Fitness(x) = f(w,s,d) 		# Weight, Stress, Displacement
    We obtain the Fitness value for each chromosomes (x) that form the population.  
    Pop contains number of chromosomes
    Results contains the analytical results from Sofistik: weight(kg/m), stress (MPa), midspan displacement (mm)
    Penalties contains the penalizations that are applied to the results w.r.t their control values
