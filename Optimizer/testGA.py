    Bridge cross section optimization by means of Genetic Algorithm and Sofistik's analysis
    Needed: Dynamo (Reivt), Python 3 and Sofistik 2020 (or 2018: modify URL)

    This script produces diferent combinations of parameters, according to some designing constraint
    and send them to Sofistik, which in turn, analyse a specific bridge with the transferred section
    parameters (FEA). Analysis results are returned to perform some GA operations and keep the loop.

    Designing parameter constrains, penalties and control values are defined in Dynamo and written to a txt.
    That data sets the properties of the GA and is read from the txt file by this script.

"""
The y=target is to minimize a function (too complex to be defined in a mathematical expresion):
    y = f(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6):
        where xi are the design parameter constrains of a bridge cross section [meters]:
        - Beam_Height           [0.30 - 0.60]
        - Beam_Thickness        [0.01 - 0.04]
        - Lane_Width            [1.50]
        - Parapet_Thickness     [0.10 - 0.16]
        - Parapet_Width         [0.30 - 0.60]
        - Slab_Thickness        [0.10]
    What are the best values for the 4 weights x1 to x4?
    A genetic algorithm is utilized in order to find the best (or close) possible values.

    # Allowable_stress = 275/1.1      # Steel S-275
    # Penalties (fictive weights that are applied when the stress or displacement are not within the min/max range)
    # Ratio range and thresholds (control values) set the GA for optimal design
"""
"""
Genetic algorithm parameters:
    Chromosomes: the higher number, higher diversity. So need less generations. Takes longer.
    Number of generations: or number of loops the GA runs. The higher, higher precision.
