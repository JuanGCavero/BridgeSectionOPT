    Bridge cross section optimization by means of Genetic Algorithm and Sofistik's analysis
    Needed: Python 3 and Sofistik 2020 (or 2018: modify URL)

    This script produces diferent combinations of parameters, according to some designing constraint
    and send them to Sofistik, which in turn, analyse a specific bridge with the transferred section
    parameters (FEA). Analysis results are returned to perform some GA operations and keep the loop.

"""

"""
The y=target is to minimize a function (too complex to be defined in a mathematical expresion):
    y = f(x1,x2,x3,x4):
        where xi are the constrained parameters of a bridge cross section [meters]:
        - Parapet_Thickness     [0.10 - 0.16]
        - Parapet_Length        [0.02 - 0.05]
        - Beam_Thickness        [0.10 - 0.30]
        - Beam_Height           [0.30 - 0.60]
        - Lane                  [1.5]
        - Beam_Height           [0.8]
    What are the best values for the 4 weights x1 to x4?
    A genetic algorithm is utilized in order to find the best (or close) possible values.
