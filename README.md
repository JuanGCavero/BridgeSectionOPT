# Parametric design and structural analysis for the optimization of bridge cross-sections.

In order to obtain a higher efficiency when designing and analyzing infrastructures, the transfer of geometry between Revit and Sofistik is solved by means of Dynamo and Python scripts for the case of railway bridges. Bridge cross-section are optimized using Genetic Algorithms.

## Prerequesites

Software:

* Revit 2020 or above
* Sofistik 2018 or above
* Python 3

Dynamo Packages:

* Clockwork for Dynamo 2.x
* Data-shapes
* Sofilink 2

## Setup and sample workflow

A handout (PDF) with the necessary instructions to perform the Linking process (Revit - Sofistik) is contained in the Repostitory.
There is also a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_vnRhejjgo&feature=youtu.be).

For the optimization process, similarly to the Linking process, download the Optimization folder from this repository and run the scripts.
